# Raspi Manager
Simple Android application for rebooting, shutting down and sending simple commands to my raspberry over a local network. The applicatoin is not secure, it uses a simple TPC connection with non encrypted data. A python script on the raspberry pi acts as a TPC server listening on port 8080.
